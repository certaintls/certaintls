## What are your rights?

You are entitled to know what personal data we are collecting about you. You have the right to request access to your personal data and you can request that we provide a copy of such data to you.

You also have the right to object to certain processing of your personal data, and request that the processing of your personal data be limited. Limitation or deletion of your personal data may result in the ISC Project not being able to fulfil its commitments to you.

Additional circumstances such as exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by EU or Member State law or processing for establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims can justify further processing by the ISC Project.

Where you withdraw your consent, certain personal data (only to the extent that it is absolutely required), will be retained on our "do not contact" list.
